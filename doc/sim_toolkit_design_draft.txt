====== SIM Toolkit design draft ======

The MeeGo SIM Application Toolkit (SATK) handles user interaction for the proactive SIM commands, through the oFono stk-agent DBus API. 
The application provides a simple QML-based user interface for the oFono SIM toolkit agent, and is completely stateless.


===== Summary =====
In a nutshell, SATK maps the oFono stk-agent DBus API to a few Qt widgets in order to provide the terminal response to the corresponding SIM commands. This section lists the proactive SIM commands that SATK needs to be aware of, and the UI widgets it uses to handle these commands in response to the oFono stk-agent DBus messages.

The commands and APIs mentionned in this section are described in the reference documents listed below:
  * 3GPP TS 11.14 v8.18.0 Specification of the SIM Application Toolkit. Pages 86/87. http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/11_series/11.14/1114-8i0.zip
  * oFono SIM Toolkit API. http://git.kernel.org/?p=network/ofono/ofono.git;a=blob;f=doc/stk-api.txt
  * oFono feature list. http://git.kernel.org/?p=network/ofono/ofono.git;a=blob;f=doc/features.txt


==== Proactive SIM commands ====

All these commands are listed in the [[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/11_series/11.14/1114-8i0.zip|3GPP TS 11.14 v8.18.0 Specification]], with the relevant terminal response, pages 86-87. 

There are other proactive commands in the 3GPP specification, but SATK needs to be aware only of the following commands, mentioned as supported in the [[http://git.kernel.org/?p=network/ofono/ofono.git;a=blob;f=doc/features.txt|oFono feature list]].

  * 02 MORE TIME
  * 10 SETUP CALL
  * 11 SEND SS
  * 12 SEND USSD
  * 13 SEND SMS
  * 14 SEND DTMF
  * 15 LAUNCH BROWSER
  * 20 PLAY TONE
  * 21 DISPLAY TEXT
  * 22 GET INKEY
  * 23 GET INPUT
  * 24 SELECT ITEM
  * 25 SETUP MENU
  * 26 PROVIDE LOCAL INFO
  * 27 TIMER MANAGEMENT
  * 28 SETUP IDLE MODE TEXT
  * 35 LANG NOTIFICATION


==== UI widgets ====

Dialogs may also have a "End" button if the corresponding proactive command accepts terminal response 10 "session terminated by user". The value returned to the SimToolkitAgent method is ''Error.SimToolkit.EndSession''.

  * NOTIF : Notification with icon and text
  * MESSAGE : Dialog with icon and text
  * YESNO : Dialog with icon and text, Yes / No buttons
  * POPUP : Dialog with icon and text, OK / Back buttons
  * INPUTKEY : Dialog with icon and text, single char input, OK / Back buttons
  * INPUTTEXT : Dialog with icon and text, multiple char input, OK / Back buttons
  * MENU : Menu with icon and text, multiple icon and text items, selection highlight, Back button

===== Core functionalities =====

==== User interface ====

=== Actions ===
The following lists all action commands that can close a widget, and the associated return value for the SimToolkitAgent method that triggered the widget opening.
There may be associated data, like entered text or selected menu item id, according to the widget.

  * YES : triggered from a boolean method, return TRUE
  * NO : triggered from a boolean method, return FALSE
  * OK : triggered from a method that returns a string / byte, return associated data
  * BACK : return ''Error.SimToolkit.GoBack''
  * END : return ''Error.SimToolkit.EndSession''

=== Widgets ===
The table below shows all the actions available to the user from a given widget. According the the SimToolkitAgent method, some of these actions may be disabled.

|           ^ Actions       ^ Data ^
^ NOTIF     | none          | void |
^ MESSAGE   | END           | void |
^ YESNO     | YES, NO, END  | boolean |
^ POPUP     | OK, BACK, END | void |
^ INPUTKEY  | OK, BACK      | single char key or digit |
^ INPUTTEXT | OK, BACK      | text string or number |
^ MENU      | OK, BACK, END | menu selection index |


==== SimToolkitAgent methods ====

The SATK handling of **org.ofono.SimToolkitAgent** methods as described in http://git.kernel.org/?p=network/ofono/ofono.git;a=blob;f=doc/stk-api.txt is detailed below. 

For each method, the possible user interactions and method response are listed. For reference, the corresponding proactive SIM command and terminal responses are also mentioned.


=== RequestSelection ===

  byte RequestSelection(string title, byte icon_id, array{struct(string, byte)} items, int16 default)

^ MENU widget actions ^ return value                ^ terminal response for ''24 SELECT ITEM'' proactive SIM command ^
| OK                  | Selected item index         | ''00'' Command performed successfully |
| BACK                | ''Error.SimToolkit.GoBack'' | ''11'' Backward move in the proactive SIM session requested by the user | 

=== DisplayText ===

  void DisplayText(string text, byte icon_id, boolean urgent)

^ NOTIF widget actions   ^ return value ^ terminal response for ''21 DISPLAY TEXT'' proactive SIM command ^
| none                   | void         | ''12'' No response from user / ''00'' Command performed successfully | 

^ MESSAGE widget actions ^ return value ^ terminal response for ''21 DISPLAY TEXT'' proactive SIM command ^
| none                   | void         | ''12'' No response from user / ''00'' Command performed successfully | 

^ POPUP widget actions   ^ return value                ^ terminal response for ''21 DISPLAY TEXT'' proactive SIM command ^
| OK                     | void                        | ''00'' Command performed successfully |
| BACK                   | ''Error.SimToolkit.GoBack'' | ''11'' Backward move in the proactive SIM session requested by the user | 
| none                   | ''Error.SimToolkit.Busy''   | ''12'' No response from user | 

**TODO** Need to figure out what to do for non-urgent actions, when the SIM session is not initiated by the user.
Check with Handset idle-screen app.
For NOTIF or MESSAGE widgets, there would be no explicit user response, oFono returns ''00'' or ''12'' to SIM.

===== MeeGo platform specifics =====

==== Launcher integration ====

The SIM Application Toolkit appears in the launcher with a name and an icon provided by the SIM card. This information is provided as properties by the **org.ofono.SimToolkit** DBUS interface. 

  * string MainMenuTitle : Contains the title of the main menu.
  * byte MainMenuIcon : Contains the identifier of the icon for the main menu. 

**TODO** The meego-app-satk.desktop file is not currently modified at runtime, the default title / icon appears in the launcher.

==== Window stacking ====

Although the SATK application is meant to be stateless, there may be a need to distinguish the cases when SATK is invoked explicitly from the launcher by user action, or from a SIM command. 

Typically SATK may handle a non-urgent DisplayText method with a message widget if invoked from the launcher, otherwise it should display a notification. 

==== Notifications ====

SATK application may rely on the MeeGo platform notification UI to display non-urgent messages.

**TODO** Need to investigate MeeGo platform notification UI support.

==== Idle screen ====

Idle screen information is provided as properties by the **org.ofono.SimToolkit** DBUS interface. 

  * string IdleModeText : Contains the text to be used when the home screen is idle.
  * byte IdleModeIcon : Contains the identifier of the icon for the main menu.
**TODO** Need to investigate Idle screen UI on MeeGo Handset platform.
